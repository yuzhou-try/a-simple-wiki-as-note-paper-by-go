=================================

A simple web application by go language. Hope to help someone to know go language at first time.

links as that:
URL: schema://host[:port#]/path/.../[?query-string][#anchor]
schema: for example, eg http, https, ftp and so on.
host: ip addr or domain name
port: is port
path: access to the resource
query-string: send some data to server
anchor: is anchor


go build wiki.go and run.

index:

http://127.0.0.1:8080/

add new page for wiki and then edit:

http://127.0.0.1:8080/view/ + [page-name or page-discuss-title]

Hope to help u :)
